Perl Text Analysis</H1>
This is a suite of Perl modules and scripts I wrote for a course in <A HREF="http://virtual.park.uga.edu/humcomp/">Humanities
Computing</A> I took at the <A HREF="http://www.uga.edu">University of
Georgia</A>. These scripts provide tools to analyze texts, and the modules
allow users to create scripts that analyze texts in other ways. At this
stage, this represents an early effort that is incomplete, ideosyncratic,
and buggy, and I recommend waiting for the next reincarnation of these
tools before using them. I hope to make it worth the wait.

<P>In the meantime, if you must use these scripts, here is some information
about them:
