<p>These scripts all take as input text files marked up with a form of
SGML so restricted as to be almost worthless. You cannot use empty
elements (with also specifying an end tag); there are no optional end
tags; and there are only start and end tags and words and numbers. As
I've said before, I'd wait for the next reincarnation.</p>

<p>There are five scripts included: <a href="#text">text.pl</a>, <a
href="#concord">concord.pl</a>, <a href="#search">search.pl</a>, <a
href="#freq">freq.pl</a>, <a href="coll">coll.pl</a>.</p>

<hr>

<a name="text"></a><h2>text.pl</h2>

<p>Text.pl prints a list of all the words in the text, in the order in
which they appear in the text, one word per line. This could be
useful to give as input to other programs.</p>

<p>Usage: <tt>text.pl &lt;file&gt;</tt></p>

<hr>

<a name="concord"></a><h2>concord.pl</h2>

<p>Concord.pl prints out a concordance of the text, citing each line
by giving the line number in the file that the word occurs on and the
character position of that word in the line.</p>

<p>Usage: <tt>concord.pl &lt;file&gt;</tt></p>

<hr>

<a name="search"></a><h2>search.pl</h2>

<p>Search.pl looks through the text for characters matching a Perl
regular expression (see <tt>man perlre</tt> for more information on
these). Notice that for some searches you may need to quote the
regular expression so search.pl recognizes it as all one command line
argument.</p>

<p>Usage: <tt>search.pl &lt;file&gt; &lt;regular
expression&gt;</tt></p>

<hr>

<a name="freq"></a><h2>freq.pl</h2>

<p>Freq.pl prints a list of all the words in the text and how many
times they occur.</p>

<p>The &quote;-f&quote; command line option forces freq.pl to sort the
results by frequency. The default sort order is alphabetic.</p>

<p>Usage: <tt>freq.pl &lt;file&gt; [-f]</tt></p>

<hr>

<a name="coll"></a><h2>coll.pl</h2>

<p>Coll.pl prints all the collocates of all the words in a text.</p>

<p>The &quote;-w&quote; option specifies how many far to look to each
side of each word. The default value is 5.</p>

<p>Usage: <tt>coll.pl &lt;file&gt; [-w &lt;number&gt;]</tt></p>
